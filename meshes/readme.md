I, Georg Bartels, copied the STL file for the kinect over from the package pr2_description,
on February 2011 2015. The copyright to it does not belong to me. At the time, pr2_description
was published under BSD license but I could not find any license header associated with this
mesh to copy here. Hence, this ad-hoc disclaimer.
